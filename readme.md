# DominoAI - DomA

## About the Project
This Python-based project is a comprehensive implementation of the classic domino game, allowing players to challenge a sophisticated AI opponent. The AI comes equipped with four distinct strategies:
Blind: A basic, non-strategic approach for a relaxed gameplay experience.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): A probabilistic strategy leveraging simulations to optimize moves.
Rule-Based: A heuristic-driven approach designed to play strategically by analyzing board state and tile options.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: An advanced minimax algorithm optimized for efficient decision-making.
Users can customize the parameters of each algorithm to modify the AIâ€™s behavior and tailor the difficulty or strategic depth of the game.
The project supports both casual and analytical gameplay, making it ideal for enthusiasts and researchers exploring AI techniques in games.
