# DominoAI - DomA

1. About the Project
This Python-based project is an implementation of the classic domino game, allowing players to challenge a sophisticated AI opponent. The AI comes equipped with four distinct strategies:
  1. Rule-Based
  2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
  3. Blind
  4. Alpha-Beta Pruning(:warning: not implemented yet)
     
Users can customize the parameters of each algorithm to modify the AIâ€™s behavior and tailor the difficulty or strategic depth of the game.
The project supports both casual and analytical gameplay, you can let AI compete with another AI.
